->implemented a basic text classification pipeline using a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) for spam classification

->loaded the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, vectorized the text using CountVectorizer,
trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, made predictions on the test set,
and evaluated the model's performance using accuracy and other classification metrics.

->predicting a new email using the trained model.
